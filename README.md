(SWT18-Project-17)

Statistics Workbench is a tool for the visualization and analyzation of data. It offers multiple mathematical functions for finding the maximum, minimum, mean, mode, maximal derivation and so on of a dataset, as well as multiple chart types, like bargraphs and piecharts.

## Getting Started

If you want to use our tool, make sure you have installed Pheno.
https://github.com/tom95/Pheno

We created multiple examples, in order to get you started with our project.
You can use examples by calling: 
```
[ExampleName] open.
```
E.g.
```
SWCreateChartExample open.
```

We also created a User Interface for users that don't want to use our code directly.
You can open the UI by calling:
```
SWGUIView new open.
```
